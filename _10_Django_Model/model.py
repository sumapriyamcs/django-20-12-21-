1.Django Model:

In Django, a model is a class which is used to contain essential fields and methods.
Each model class maps to a single table in the database.

Django Model is a subclass of django.db.models.Model and each field of the
model class represents a database field (column).

Django provides us a database-abstraction API which allows us to create,
retrieve, update and delete a record from the mapped table.

Model is defined in Models.py file. This file can contain multiple models.

we are creating a model Employee which has two fields first_name and last_name.

from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

The first_name and last_name fields are specified as class attributes and
each attribute maps to a database column.

This model will create a table into the database that looks like below.

CREATE TABLE appname_employee (
    "id" INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);

The created table contains an auto-created id field.
The name of the table is a combination of app name and model name that can be changed further.


2.Register / Use Model:

After creating a model, register model into the INSTALLED_APPS inside settings.py.

For example,

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'appname',
    #...
]

3.Django Model Fields:

The fields defined inside the Model class are the columns name of the mapped table.
The fields name should not be python reserve words like clean, save or delete etc.

Django provides various built-in fields types.

3.Django Model Fields Example:

first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50) # for creating varchar column
release_date = models.DateField()                        # for creating date column
num_stars = models.IntegerField()                       # for creating integer column


4.Field Options:

Each field requires some arguments that are used to set column attributes.
For example, CharField requires mac_length to specify varchar database.

Common arguments available to all field types. All are optional.

FieldOptions                             	Particulars
Null	                    Django will store empty values as NULL in the database.
Blank	                    It is used to allowed field to be blank.
Choices                 	An iterable (e.g., a list or tuple) of 2-tuples to use
                            as choices for this field.

Default	                    The default value for the field. This can be a value
                            or a callable object.

help_text	                Extra "help" text to be displayed with the form widget.
                            It's useful for documentation even if your field
                            isn't used on a form.

primary_key             	This field is the primary key for the model.
Unique	                    This field must be unique throughout the table.


5.Django Model Example:

We created a model Student that contains the following code in models.py file.

//models.py

class Student(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    last_name  = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    contact    = models.IntegerField()
    email      = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
    age        = models.IntegerField()
After that apply migration by using the following command.

python3 manage.py makemigrations myapp

It will create a table myapp_student
