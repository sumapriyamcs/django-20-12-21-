1.Django Virtual Environment Setup:

The virtual environment is an environment which is used by Django to execute an application.
It is recommended to create and execute a Django application in a separate
environment. Python provides a tool virtualenv to create an isolated Python
environment. We will use this tool to create a virtual environment for our Django application.

To set up a virtual environment, use the following steps.

1. Install Package

First, install python3-venv package by using the following command.

$ apt-get install python3-venv

2. Create a Directory

$ mkdir djangoenv

After it, change directory to the newly created directory by using the cd djangoenv.

3. Create Virtual Environment

$ python3 -m venv djangoenv

4. Activate Virtual Environment

After creating a virtual environment, activate it by using the following command.

$ source djangoenv/bin/activate

Till here, the virtual environment has started. Now, we can use it to create Django application.

2.Install Django:

Install Django in the virtual environment. To install Django, use the following command.

$ pip install django

Django has installed successfully. Now we can create a new project and
build new applications in the separate environment.
